    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Unity Tweak Tool is now in the Raring repository!</h3>

<p>It's been wholly four months since we started development on unity-tweak-tool and two months since it was <a href="http://unbrokenspectrum.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/unity-tweak-tool-for-the-power-user-in-you/">available for wider testing</a>. And now, finally, it is in the Ubuntu repository for 13.04 release!</p>

<p>Many thanks to the MOTU reviewers Daniel Holbach, Michael Terry and Bhavani Shankar, who also sponsored the package. Also extending the cordiality to Adam Conrad (~infinity) for a final review on the distributability of the package as an archive admin. And, last but not the least, thanks to the Ubuntu community for their feedback during the development, which was really helpful in shaping this product for the better.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now that I have gotten that out of the way, we are going to start work for the s-cycle (or is it rolling?). That includes finishing the rewrite of the backend for better maintainability and making it easier for us to extend the current set of features.</p>

<p>We also have some exciting plans in our mind for the s-cycle (or rolling, depending on how <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2013-February/036537.html">that discussion</a> ends up), that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to preset settings (switching settings based on context)</li>
<li>Sync the settings — potentially across various computers — using Ubuntu One</li>
<li>Back up and restore settings, for those feeling adventurous yet unwilling to compromise their current setup.</li>
</ul>


<p>Also in the to-do list for the upcoming cycle includes some relatively boring items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Search bar</li>
<li>Installing and removing themes from tarballs</li>
<li>Unit tests to prevent any new bugs from creeping in and to increase the quality of the code</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/auto-pkg-test.html#what-you-can-do">Autopkgtests</a> — Automatic testing for packages</li>
<li>Extensive debug logs for better bug-hunting.</li>
</ul>


<p>Please do keep in mind that these plans are tentative in nature and it very much depends on how Unity development pans out over the next year or so. We'll try our best to create a tweak tool for the Qt/QML based Unity as and when it becomes available for users.</p>
